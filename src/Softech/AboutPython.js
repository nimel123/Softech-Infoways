           </center>
           Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, 
           high-level programming language with dynamic semantics.
            Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic 
            typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application 
            Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect
             existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes
              readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports 
              modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and
               the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.

           <h1>Why Python?</h1>
           </center>
           1.Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).<br/><br/>
2.Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.<br/><br/>
3.Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.<br/><br/>
4.Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.<br/><br/>
5.Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.
