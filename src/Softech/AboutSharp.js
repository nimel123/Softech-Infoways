                C# is a general-purpose, modern and object-oriented programming language
                 pronounced as “C sharp”. It was developed by Microsoft led by Anders Hejlsberg and
                  his team within the .Net initiative and was approved by the European Computer
                   Manufacturers Association (ECMA) and International Standards Organization (ISO). 
                   C# is among the languages for Common Language Infrastructure and the current version
                    of C# is version 7.2. C# is a lot similar to Java syntactically and is easy for the 
                    users who have knowledge of C, C++ or Java. A bit about .Net Framework .
                    Net applications are multi-platform applications and framework can be used from
                     languages like C++, C#, Visual Basic, COBOL etc. It is designed in a manner so that other

         1.Easy to start: C# is a high-level language so it is closer to other popular programming languages like C, C++, and Java and thus becomes easy to learn for anyone. <br/><br/>
2.Widely used for developing Desktop and Web Application: C# is widely used for developing web applications and Desktop applications. It is one of the most popular languages that is used in professional desktop. If anyone wants to create Microsoft apps, C# is their first choice. <br/><br/>
3.Community:The larger the community the better it is as new tools and software will be developing to make it better. C# has a large community so the developments are done to make it exist in the system and not become extinct. <br/><br/>
4.Game Development: C# is widely used in game development and will continue to dominate. C# integrates with Microsoft and thus has a large target audience.
